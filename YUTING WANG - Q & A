What do you think about VR Headsets being used to give a real experience in a water slide to people who have movement disabilities?

- It can be very exciting for them
- It might be risky for some certain people with heart deasease
- Brings hope for those people who feel desperate for their disability

Would you consider riding in an Autonomous Vehicle that is safe with a VR Headset to experience a water slide? Why?

Yes and No. 
- Yes is because I think it can be really fun for 4D experience and I don't need to worry my clothes get wet. 
- No is because I am really concerned about privacy and safty issue of atonomous cars.

Do you think people with movement disabilities would go on a ride like this? Why?

I think 80% yes. I mean people only live once in their life, so most of them would like to try something different and get as more experiences as they can.
However rest of 20% people probably would feel bit scared about new tech, or stay alone in antonomous car with those equipment they are unfamiliar totally with.
